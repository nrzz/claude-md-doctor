# Contributing to claude-md-doctor

Thanks for helping. claude-md-doctor is a CLI and a Claude Code plugin with one user-only skill, part of the [Claude Code toolkit](https://github.com/nrzz/claude-code-toolkit). The bar for a change is the bar the code already meets: it works on Windows, macOS and Linux, it is tested, and it never wastes anyone's tokens.

## Start here

- **Good first issues:** [the issues labelled good first issue](https://github.com/nrzz/claude-md-doctor/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), and the ideas in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
- **Questions and ideas:** [Discussions](https://github.com/nrzz/claude-md-doctor/discussions).
- **Bugs:** [open an issue](https://github.com/nrzz/claude-md-doctor/issues/new/choose) with the Claude Code version (`claude --version`), your OS, `node --version`, and the exact command and output.

## Set up

There is nothing to install: the project has no dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nrzz/claude-md-doctor
cd claude-md-doctor
npm test
```

- `node bin/claude-md-doctor.mjs <a project> --no-user` prints the report; `--json` and `--markdown` for tools and pull-request comments.
- `--fix` writes a lean proposal next to your files without changing them.

## Where things are

| Path | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `bin/claude-md-doctor.mjs` | the CLI |
| `src/` | discovery and imports, the token estimate, the checks (`src/checks/`), the fix planner and the reports |
| `test/` | fixture projects for every finding, with false-positive guards, and random-input tests |

## House rules

1. **No dependencies.** Node built-ins only, Node 18 or newer, ES modules (`.mjs`). A pull request that adds a package to `dependencies` will not be merged.
2. **Every change comes with a test**, and `npm test` passes. CI runs the suite on Windows, macOS and Linux with Node 20, 22 and 24; a change that only works on one of them is not done.
3. **Token cost is a feature.** It runs outside Claude; the optional skill is user-only and replies in at most 8 lines. If your change puts anything new in front of Claude, say how many tokens in the pull request and update the README's "What it costs in tokens".
4. **Never touch real user data in tests.** Use a temporary folder and point `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `HOME` and `USERPROFILE` at it. Tests never read `~/.claude/projects`; build synthetic transcripts instead. Build any fake secret from pieces (`"gh" + "p_" + ...`) so secret scanners do not flag the source.
5. **Settings files are the user's.** Back them up before writing, change only your own keys or hook entries, and leave a file that is not valid JSON alone.
6. **Keep the README honest.** Its "What was verified, and how" section says what was checked and what was not. If your change affects either, update it in the same pull request.

## Pull requests

- One logical change per pull request, with its test. Commit messages in the imperative mood ("Add a rule for gem push").
- Fill in the pull request template; CI must be green on all nine jobs.
- Signed commits are welcome but not required.
- Plain, specific writing in docs, messages and comments.

## Releases (maintainers)

Bump the version in `package.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, add a section to [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), tag `vX.Y.Z` and publish a GitHub release with the changelog section as its notes.
